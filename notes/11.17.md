# Probalistic Data-Driven Sampling via Multi-Criteria Importance Analysis

I/O small, CPU fast, select partial dataset
**Main Point**
Sampling combine both local and global data properties

**Critical Data**
Outlier, Unique data point. With higher gradient.

**why not online visualization**
Cross domain areas, further analysis using different kinds of data, and use these data in different ways.

## Method
1. Value-based importance
2. Local smoothness-based importance
